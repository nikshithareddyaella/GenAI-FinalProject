        The web application is built using the following technologies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Frontend:</b> Angular</li>
        <li><b>Backend:</b> Java Spring Boot</li>
        <li><b>Database:</b> MySQL</li>
        <li><b>Authentication:</b> JWT (JSON Web Token)</li>
        <li><b>Hosting:</b> NGINX for frontend, Backend running on port 3000</li>
        <li><b>App Type:</b> Single Page Application (SPA)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="card-text">
        The frontend and backend are fully decoupled, with asynchronous communication through <b>HTTP GET</b> requests for fetching chart data. The app is designed for functionality, focusing on delivering key features such as user authentication via a login page, dynamic chart rendering, and easy navigation between the dashboard and other sections.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        The app is built to prioritize <b>ADA/WCAG accessibility</b> principles, ensuring that users with disabilities can access and navigate the site effectively. The login credentials are hardcoded for testing purposes, but in a production environment, they would be encrypted and securely stored in the database.
