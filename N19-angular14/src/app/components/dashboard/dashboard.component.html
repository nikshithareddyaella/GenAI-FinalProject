            <p class="card-text">
              The web application is built using the following technologies:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Frontend:</b> Angular</li>
              <li><b>Backend:</b> Java Spring Boot</li>
              <li><b>Database:</b> MySQL</li>
              <li><b>Authentication:</b> JWT (JSON Web Token)</li>
              <li>
                <b>Hosting:</b> NGINX for frontend, Backend running on port 3000
              </li>
              <li><b>App Type:</b> Single Page Application (SPA)</li>
              <li>
                <b>Favicon:</b> Integrated custom favicon for branding and
                usability
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Register Page:</b> Added an extra page for user registration
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="card-text">
              The frontend and backend are fully decoupled, with asynchronous
              communication through <b>HTTP GET</b> requests for fetching chart
              data. The app is designed for functionality, focusing on
              delivering key features such as user authentication via a login
              page, dynamic chart rendering, and easy navigation between the
              dashboard and other sections.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              The app encrypts passwords securely and reads encrypted
              credentials directly from the database for authentication
              purposes. This approach ensures enhanced security in both testing
              and production environments.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              The app is built to prioritize
              <b>ADA/WCAG accessibility</b> principles, ensuring that users with
              disabilities can access and navigate the site effectively.
